# Dreammjow's Personal Filters

I decided to make my own filters in order to prevent tracking or block ads, which are not covered by other filters. However, it may cause some website breakage. Feel free to contribute.

### RAW link: [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreammjow/MyFilters/main/src/filters.txt)

## Recommended extensions/browsers to use this filter:

* [uBlockOrigin](https://ublockorigin.com/)
* [Brave's Shield](https://brave.com/download)

It can also be used with [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/download/) and other browsers.
