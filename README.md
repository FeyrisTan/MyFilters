# Dreammjow's Personal Filters

I decided to make my own filters in order to prevent tracking or block ads, which are not covered by other filters. However, it may cause some website breakage. Feel free to contribute.

## Recommended extensions/browsers to use this filter:

* [uBlockOrigin](https://ublockorigin.com/)
* [Brave's Shield](https://brave.com/download) - Currently, it doesn't support custom URL filters. However, selecting/copying everything from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreammjow/MyFilters/main/src/filters.txt) and pasting it into `brave://adblock/` â†’ `Custom Filters` works fine.

It can also be used with [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/download/) and other browsers.
